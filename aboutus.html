    <h2>Background on the Founder</h2>
    <p> Hello and welcome to the About Page !! My name is Marcus Johnican and I am the founder of Louu’s Camp-o-rade . While, unfortunately, I haven’t went camping myself, I have seen a lot of shows/movies and have done some research upon the matter .
        <br>
        In my youth , I never really thought about actually going to some-sort of camp or activity center . It just didn’t really seem like something I would find intriguing . But as I grew older and became a bit more adventurous , the thought of camping definitely crossed my mind quite often .
        <br>
         So as I stated in the opening paragraph, I became inspired by other camp websites and other people’s experiences and decided to try and make a campground with joyous activities and give fun experiences . Hopefully this page will also give insight to people, like me, a better understanding when it comes to camping. It may bring them out of their comfort zone and try living outdoors for a few days/weeks, with safety precautions
         Of course. </p>
